# GABA Mean template

A template used to bootstrap a MEAN application. This template does the following things: 
1. Places client side code in the app folder. 
2. Places configuration files for JSHint, JSCS, bower, npm, and git in the root directory. 
3. Installs 'gaba-gulp-tasks' which includes tasks for compiling less, running test code and performing other normal operations. Check out https://github.com/bradbart/gaba-gulp-tasks for more information. 
4. Installs 'angular', 'bootstrap', 'angular-ui-router', and 'angular-animate' as bower components.
